## Let's Keep Our River Clean!

The **Community Clean-Up Day** is a fun, hands-on way to make a tangible difference in our neighborhood. We will be focusing on the Riverside Park area, removing litter to protect local wildlife and improve water quality.

### What to Bring
*   Comfortable walking shoes
*   Sunscreen and a hat
*   Reusable water bottle
*   *We will provide:* Gloves, trash bags, grabbers, and vests.

### Why it Matters
Last year, we removed over **1,200 lbs of trash** from the riverbanks. This effort not only beautifies our park but prevents plastic pollution from entering the ocean.

### Post-Cleanup BBQ
After the hard work, stick around for a free BBQ lunch for all volunteers at the Riverside Pavilion! Vegetarian options will be available.

**Safety Note:** Children under 12 must be accompanied by an adult.
